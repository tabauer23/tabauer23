- Hi, I’m Trevor.
- I’m interested in expanding my coding data mindset and actively get other people interested in coding to make life more simple.
- I have been coding R now for about two years, and really pushing to expand my network with other fellow coders to bounce ideas off of to ensure 
processes are going efficiently as possible.
- I’m currently learning R coding to better integrate repeatable reports at my organization.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that has to do with R coding, from beginners to advanced coders. 
- How to reach me trevor.a.bauer@dhhs.nh.gov or bauer.trevor@gmail.com
